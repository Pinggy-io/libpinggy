### Feat-NewSession
* Every thing seems working fine without any issue.
* Currently I am working on basic stuff only. Not removing primary forwarding yet. I can work on that only after deployment or findout a way to make client backword compatible.
* Added support for protocol based greeting msg and usages info communication instead of extra channel. Made it backward compatible. However, not tested.
